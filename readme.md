# SIMPLE BOGGLE GAME

Boggle is a word game in which players attempt to find words in sequences of adjacent letters on a plastic grid (5x5) of lettered dice.

It can be played as multi or single player. While playing with multiple players, if the same words found by more than one player none will get point for that word.
